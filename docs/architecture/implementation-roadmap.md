> This Accepted Phase 7 roadmap is the locked implementation-sequencing input.
> It grants no authority to change code, schema, policies, production data,
> infrastructure, or deployment configuration. Acceptance does not mean that
> implementation, migration, security, test, rehearsal, or deployed evidence
> has passed; those remain separate execution gates.

## 1. Purpose and boundaries

Phase 7 owns dependency order, implementation boundaries, evidence, approvals,
and stop conditions for the Accepted package. It does not own implementation
execution, production migration, deployment, cutover, test results, or a new
architecture decision. Roadmap acceptance locks a sequence; it is not
implementation completion. Implementation evidence validates repository work,
migration evidence validates transforms/rehearsals, and deployed evidence
validates an authorized environment. Accepted architecture cannot be weakened
silently for convenience; a repository conflict is a blocking input.

### Authority and precedence

1. The [frozen v1 report](../v1-codebase-feature-and-flow-report.md) for verified current behaviour only.
2. Accepted ADRs.
3. Accepted Phase 2–6 architecture documents.
4. Accepted migration and parity decisions.
5. [Deferred-Scope Register](../product/deferred-scope-register.md).
6. This roadmap, for sequencing only.
7. Implementation artifacts after Phase 7 acceptance.

## 3. Current implementation baseline

Repository inspection identifies a React 18/Vite/TypeScript client with
Tailwind and `@supabase/supabase-js`. `App.tsx` holds one of five hardcoded
personas in client memory and routes Trip, Scan, Split, FX, and Todo tabs.
Hooks issue global `events`, `expenses`, `settlements`, and name-filtered Todo
queries and broad realtime subscriptions. Supabase Auth, Groups, Profiles,
membership, Invitations, lifecycle, Tenant routing, and Active Group are absent.

Legacy SQL uses display-name references, permissive policies, public flat
`tickets` Storage, and name-keyed Todos. The reachable parser function uses
elevated capability, public Storage, and client-supplied identity/audience
values. Finance uses scalar/array/JSON names, a static 188.68 accounting
conversion, legacy Astitva→Partha routing, and separate live FX. Existing Vite
and TypeScript build scripts exist; tests, lint, CI, deployment specification,
and production facts are absent or unknown. These are repository facts, not
deployed facts or target authority.

| Baseline class | State | Roadmap treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Implemented and observed | UI tabs, global queries/realtime, migrations, parser, build | Preserve verified product behaviour only through safe adaptation |
| Present but incomplete | Supabase client, PWA dependency, finance/document code | Re-evaluate; presence is not acceptance evidence |
| Legacy/insecure | Personas, PIN rows, global access, public Storage, permissive policies | Replace/contain; never authority |
| Absent | Auth/Tenant/RLS matrix/private Storage/secure realtime/tests/CI | Implement only after Phase 7 acceptance |
| Unknown | Production rows, objects, policies, topology, backups, retention | Blocking input where affected |
| Deferred | Commercial, providers, private Events, payments, organizations, global guides, dormant AI | Excluded under DEF-001–DEF-012 |

## 4. Implementation principles

- Derive Tenant ownership from authoritative parent relationships, never client
  Group IDs, Active Group, persona, display name, PIN, Profile, or unclaimed identity.
- Use Supabase Auth, stable Participants, explicit lifecycle, Owner/Member only,
  deny-by-default access, private Storage, authorized realtime, and confined service role.
- Make bootstrap, Invitation, lifecycle, claiming, finance, and documents atomic,
  retry-safe, idempotent, auditable, and fail closed.
- Preserve deterministic finance, configured accounting currency, historical FX
  evidence, live-FX separation, and Group-confined destination content.
- Advance only on evidence; retain one authority per migration stage; recover
  without public/global/cross-Tenant access; deliver minimal reversible increments.

The graph is acyclic: every edge moves from foundation, to contracts/Auth/RLS,
to the trusted-operation boundary, to authoritative lifecycle/security/product
work, to transforms/evidence, to rehearsal/release. Critical path: IR-001 →
IR-002 → IR-004 → IR-007 → IR-008 → IR-003 → IR-005 → IR-006 → IR-011 →
IR-012/IR-013/IR-014/IR-015 → IR-016 and IR-021 → IR-017 → IR-018 →
separately authorized IR-019 → IR-020. IR-009 and IR-010 may proceed in
parallel after IR-008 and IR-005; product lanes may proceed in parallel only
after their explicit graph dependencies. No feature may bypass Tenant, identity,
authorization, audit, trusted-operation, or evidence gates.

### Dependency edge register and cycle rule

The Mermaid diagram and this edge register have the identical **84 unique
edges**: IR-001→IR-002/IR-004/IR-022; IR-002→IR-003/IR-004/IR-007/IR-014/IR-022; IR-003→IR-005/IR-006/IR-011/IR-012/IR-015/IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-004→IR-003/IR-005/IR-007/IR-021/IR-022; IR-005→IR-006/IR-009/IR-010/IR-011/IR-021/IR-022; IR-006→IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-007→IR-003/IR-005/IR-008/IR-009/IR-010/IR-011/IR-021/IR-022; IR-008→IR-003/IR-005/IR-006/IR-009/IR-010/IR-012/IR-013/IR-014/IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-009→IR-013/IR-021/IR-022; IR-010→IR-011/IR-021/IR-022; IR-011→IR-012/IR-013/IR-014/IR-015/IR-021/IR-022; IR-012→IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-013→IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-014→IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-015→IR-016/IR-021/IR-022; IR-016→IR-017/IR-021/IR-022; IR-017→IR-018; IR-018→IR-019; IR-019→IR-020; IR-021→IR-017; IR-022→IR-017/IR-018/IR-019/IR-020. IR-022 is completed from IR-001–IR-016 gate
inputs and does not depend on IR-021; IR-021 evidence is recorded in the
already-created ledger and joins IR-016 and IR-022 at IR-017. The complete
graph is topologically validated before gate acceptance; duplicate declarations
and back-edges are rejected.

## 7. Work-item catalogue

All work items are **Planned**. “Areas” names likely repository areas, not
authorization to edit them. Each row supplies status, wave/workstream, objective,
Accepted sources, dependencies, areas, boundary, evidence, migration/parity/
security traceability, failure/recovery, release status, parallel class, review,
and definition of done.

## 8. Foundation and developer-evidence workstream

IR-001 establishes reproducible local setup, environment separation,
migration-safe isolated fixtures, schema/type and contract checks, audit-safe
logs, secret exclusion, rollback evidence, CI gate capability, deployed-smoke
capability, and retained evidence. Existing Vite and TypeScript tooling may be
reused where adequate. The repository has no test, lint, CI, deployment, or
environment specification proving these capabilities; selecting a missing
framework or dependency is a later implementation input, not a decision here.

## 9. Data and Tenant workstream

IR-002 through IR-006 sequence Users/Profiles, one Group per Trip Tenant,
mandatory Group configuration, stable Group Members/Participants, Owner and
Member roles only, Invitations, lifecycle, archival/restoration, last-Owner
continuity, Legacy Participants/claims, Events/audiences, Todos, normalized
finance, private document metadata/objects, and audit/provenance. Every
Group-owned record uses its Accepted parent path. S05 remains atomic: Group,
configuration, stable creator membership, active Owner, and audit provenance
commit together or not at all.

## 10. Security implementation workstream

IR-007–IR-010 sequence deny-by-default RLS and cross-Tenant/object-substitution
denial; inactive/removed/archive behaviour; trusted-operation rollback;
last-Owner, Invitation, and claim races; service-role confinement; Profile
privacy; Invitation-secret protection; private Storage; current-authorization
realtime/reconnect/removal; generic failures; abuse resistance; audit/provenance;
and two-Group adversarial fixtures. No wave permits anonymous, public, global,
browser-service-role, or cross-Tenant access during migration or cutover.

## 11. Product and parity workstreams

IR-011–IR-015 retain all 20 FP rows and 14 UI groups through safe adaptations:
Auth/session and Group selection replace persona authentication; Event audiences
remain presentation/assignment, not private Events; manual and scan-derived
Events, Todos, documents, finance, FX, Bali content, realtime, and recognizable
mobile interaction follow authority foundations. The Accepted corrections remain:
no impersonation, safer failures, private reconciled documents, exact non-equal
shares, general settlement suggestions, FX recalculation, and configuration time.

## 12. Migration and cutover workstream

IR-016–IR-020 consume S01–S19: immutable inventory, rehearsal, secured target,
bootstrap, Participants/configuration, operational/finance/object transforms,
scoped query/realtime, claims, validation, freeze/delta, separately authorized
cutover, monitoring, recovery, and containment. Production execution needs
separate authority, actual inventory, approved Owner/adjudications, maintenance
decision, and recovery capability. Recovery never restores personas, PIN
authority, public Storage, permissive RLS, global queries, or global realtime.

## 13. Deterministic finance implementation order

IR-014 establishes immutable stable Participant identity order, then exact
contribution/final-share persistence, configured accounting currency,
original/accounting amounts, static legacy-rate evidence, Settlement limits,
atomic writes, reconciliation, and suggestions. It uses the Accepted fixtures:
100 IDR across `P-01`, `P-02`, `P-03` yields 34/33/33. With Settlement inputs
`P-01=-60`, `P-02=-40`, `P-03=+50`, `P-04=+50`, transfers are exactly
`P-01→P-03:50`, `P-01→P-04:10`, `P-02→P-04:40`. The non-Bali fixture records a
12.34 USD Settlement in that Group's configured accounting currency and reaches
exact configured-currency zero. Bali-only below-one-IDR compatibility never
becomes a non-Bali tolerance or Settlement-currency rule. Live FX is reference
conversion, never ledger authority.

## 14. Document and scan implementation order

IR-013 follows private Storage and trusted boundaries: validate file types,
private upload, derived uploader provenance, non-authoritative extraction,
field validation, Event/document/audience association, accepted client
audience-override presentation semantics, parse/database failure,
object/metadata orphan reconciliation, authorized list/view/download/removal,
inactive/archive/cross-Group denial, and legacy public-object migration. An AI
provider/model identifier is not a parity requirement. Client audience overrides
never create private or secret Events: active same-Group Members retain Accepted
database-read authority.

## 15. Testing and evidence roadmap

| Evidence category | Prerequisite / fixture | Expected outcome and retained artifact | Reviewer / consuming gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static/document traceability | Accepted package and source inventory | Requirement-to-IR reference report | Architecture; W1/W5 |
| Deterministic calculations | Canonical isolated Participant/finance fixtures | Exact shares, balances, suggestions, FX-separation report | Finance/data; W4/W5 |
| Database/RLS security | Two unrelated Groups and lifecycle variants | Positive/negative matrix and substitution results | Security; W3/W5 |
| Trusted-operation concurrency | Controlled failure/race fixtures | Atomicity, retry, last-Owner, Invitation, claim artifacts | Security/architecture; W3/W5 |
| Storage/realtime | Private objects; lifecycle/reconnect contexts | Current-authorization/no-leak evidence | Security; W3/W5 |
| Application/E2E/visual | Authorized Member/Participant fixtures | FP/UI flow, safe-error, interaction review | Product; W4/W5 |
| Migration/rehearsal | Reviewed manifest, isolated representative evidence | Mapping/checksum/reconciliation/recovery artifacts | Data/security/release; W5/W6 |
| Deployed smoke/post-cutover | Separately authorized secured environment | Auth, isolation, document, realtime, monitoring evidence | Release/security; W7 |

Repository presence is not execution or deployed evidence. Every artifact
records prerequisite, fixture, expected outcome, reviewer, consuming gate, and
retention location without secrets or unnecessary personal data.

entry needs implementation evidence before its consuming release gate; no
existing module implies completion.

|---|---|

| Data-preservation only | IR-014/IR-016; reconciliation evidence in IR-021/017 |
| Not a v1 parity feature | IR-022 exclusion evidence; no feature implementation |
| Deferred | Owning DEF map and IR-022 scope evidence; no implementation |
| Target-only conformance | IR-002–IR-010; TC/security evidence in IR-021 |

## 17. Release gates

Release is blocked by a missing or cyclic dependency; missing Accepted
requirement; retained data without Tenant; unresolved identity used as authority;
incomplete Auth/membership/Owner lifecycle; possible ownerless or partial
bootstrap; cross-Tenant success; public document authority; global unauthorized
realtime; PIN or Invitation-secret authority; service-role exposure; partial
trusted operation; finance/document mismatch; unreconciled retry; incomplete
intentional-exception evidence; unsafe rollback/recovery; incomplete delta;
stale client reaching insecure authority; incomplete post-cutover reconciliation;
or a Deferred feature. IR-022 maintains the gate ledger; IR-019 still requires
separate production authority.

## 18. Rollout, compatibility, and recovery

Implementation increments preserve one authoritative system per migration stage.
Any conceptual exposure or compatibility control must fail closed and never
create dual authority or a public/global interval. Source write-freeze,
secured-target readiness, final delta, stale-client containment, observability,
reconciliation windows, and retirement follow S14–S19. Where rollback would
restore insecurity, forward recovery is required. Recovery keeps documents
private, audit evidence intact, and writes reconciled.

## 19. Execution inputs, approvals, and risks

| Missing input | Needed by / blocks | Approval and acceptable evidence | Safe default / parallel work |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment topology and deployment access | IR-001, IR-017–019 | Operations/security; reviewed environment inventory | No deployment; local/document work continues |
| Deployed schema, RLS, Auth, row/object inventory | IR-016 onward | Data/security; timestamped safe manifest | No source mutation; target work continues |
| Initial Owner Auth identity/verification | IR-003/S05 | Product/security; reviewed execution manifest | No authoritative Group; preparation only |
| Participant adjudications/duplicates | IR-006/016 | Product/data/security/architecture; non-secret record | Keep unclaimed; other work continues |
| Finance/document discrepancies | IR-014/016/017 | Data/finance/security; exception disposition | Quarantine affected unit |
| Maintenance window/writers/stale-client plan | IR-018–019 | Release/security/product; approved plan | No cutover; rehearsal may continue |
| Backup/recovery/retention capability | IR-017–020 | Operations/data/security; tested capability record | No destructive retirement |
| Operational approvers/security ownership | Any release gate | Product/architecture/security/release categories | Hold only affected gate |
| Test/framework capability selection | IR-001 before executable evidence; blocks IR-021 | Architecture/security/product; selection record comparing deterministic calculation, database/RLS, Storage, realtime, concurrency, E2E, CI and isolated-fixture capability | Use existing tooling for documentation/static checks only; unrelated contract/data work may continue |

No actual identifier, credential, secret, personal datum, or production content
belongs in this roadmap or its evidence ledger.

## 20. Deferred-scope compliance

IR-022 checks [DEF-001 through DEF-012](../product/deferred-scope-register.md):
no paid plans, Entitlements, extra providers, permanent friend Groups, roles
beyond Owner/Member, automatic Invitation email, private/secret Events, payments,
wallets, organization administration, worldwide guides, automatic/global content,
or dormant AI delivery. Sequencing changes no register status or decision.

| Deferred boundary | Consuming IR work | Required scope evidence |
|---|---|---|
| DEF-001 | IR-022 | No paid plan, subscription, trial, or paywall |
| DEF-002 | IR-022 | No premium Entitlement authority |
| DEF-003 | IR-004 | No Google OAuth or additional provider |
| DEF-004 | IR-002, IR-011 | One Group remains one Trip, not a friend container |
| DEF-005 | IR-015 | Bali content is not a worldwide guide |
| DEF-006 | IR-005 | No automatic Invitation delivery |
| DEF-007 | IR-005 | Only Owner and Member roles |
| DEF-008 | IR-012 | Audience presentation does not create private Events |
| DEF-009 | IR-014 | Settlement is not payment processing |
| DEF-010 | IR-014 | No wallet, custody, or stored balance |
| DEF-011 | IR-002, IR-011 | No organization administration |
| DEF-012 | IR-015, IR-022 | No automatic/global content or dormant-AI delivery |

## 21. Definition of implementation-ready

Phase 7 acceptance completes the final documentation lock before implementation
begins. IR-022 then maintains implementation and release-gate evidence; it does
not defer that initial lock until after implementation. The first implementation
task may begin only after no architecture contradiction remains, the critical
path and initial slice are approved, repository/environment prerequisites and
verification capabilities are known, rollback and approval boundaries are
identified, and deferred-scope review passes. This Accepted roadmap by itself
satisfies none of those execution conditions.

## 22. Phase 7 acceptance checklist

- [x] Accepted-input completeness is verified.
- [x] Source precedence is explicit and preserved.
- [x] Repository baseline statements are repository-verifiable and accurate.
- [x] Roadmap acceptance is distinct from implementation and execution evidence.
- [x] The dependency graph is complete and readable.
- [x] The critical path is explicit and acyclic.
- [x] Parallel work boundaries are safe and explicit.
- [x] Every work item has evidence, gate, recovery, and traceability fields.
- [x] Target data-model sequencing preserves Tenant ownership.
- [x] Auth and Profile sequencing preserves Supabase Auth authority.
- [x] Group, membership, Owner, Invitation, and claiming sequencing is complete.
- [x] RLS and cross-Tenant security sequencing is complete.
- [x] Storage, realtime, secret, and service-role security sequencing is complete.
- [x] Event and audience sequencing preserves non-private semantics.
- [x] Todo sequencing preserves Participant ownership.
- [x] Document and scan sequencing preserves private reconciliation.
- [x] Finance and FX sequencing preserves deterministic separation.
- [x] Destination-content sequencing preserves Group-confined scope.

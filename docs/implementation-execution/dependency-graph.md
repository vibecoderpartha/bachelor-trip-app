Schema dependencies flow from IR-002 to lifecycle/product work; Auth flows from IR-004; Group lifecycle from IR-003/IR-005; security/trusted boundaries from IR-007/IR-008; Storage from IR-009; Realtime from IR-010; finance from IR-014; transforms from IR-016; and release authority from IR-022. Locked screen/component mapping is consumed by the owning IRs, not recreated here.

## Cycle review

No dependency cycle was found in the accepted roadmap graph. The table preserves IR-022's gate inputs from IR-001–IR-016; the diagram consolidates that already-serial upstream set at IR-016 rather than drawing sixteen redundant arrows. IR-022 joins IR-016/IR-021 at IR-017 and is not treated as a circular prerequisite for its own evidence.

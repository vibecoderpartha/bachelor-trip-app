This document summarizes ownership without replacing the accepted manifests.

integrated evidence where named; no row is a completion claim.

## Non-primary visual ownership still requiring evidence

IR-001 establishes evidence capability; IR-002 establishes Tenant/data
foundations; IR-008 establishes trusted-operation boundaries; IR-019 is a
separately authorised cutover gate; and IR-020 owns post-release containment.
They have limited or no primary screen ownership, but each remains traceable to
packet security, test, rollback, observability, and gate evidence. The absence
of a primary visual screen never removes an implementation evidence obligation.

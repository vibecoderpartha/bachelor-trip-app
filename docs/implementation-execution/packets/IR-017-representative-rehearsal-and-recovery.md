# IR-017 — Representative rehearsal and recovery
## 1. Status and ownership

- Status: Draft
- Wave: W6
- Primary implementation owner: Not assigned unless documented
- Review owners: architecture, security, database/migration, design, and product reviewers as applicable
- Implementation authorised: No

## 2. Objective

Plan isolated representative rehearsal, repeated failure injection, recovery, timing, rollback, and retained S01–S13/S18 evidence.

## 3. Authoritative inputs

Migration plan; roadmap IR-017; IR-016 manifests; IR-021 evidence; IR-022 gate ledger.

The accepted documents govern; this Draft packet does not restate or amend their decisions.

## 4. Entry gate

Verified exit evidence for IR-016, IR-021, IR-022., clean repository, accepted design mapping, and no unresolved prerequisite security or architecture contradiction.

## 5. Dependencies

- Direct IR dependencies: IR-016, IR-021, IR-022.
- Schema dependencies: target schema/data contracts approved by owning earlier packets where applicable
- Auth dependencies: session-derived actor and current membership where applicable
- Trusted-operation dependencies: IR-008 for any authoritative atomic action
- Design dependencies: accepted docs/ui-design/manifests/screen-manifest.json and relevant screen contracts
- Test/fixture dependencies: IR-001 capability and packet-specific fixture/evidence plan

## 6. In scope

Draft rehearsal environment requirements, snapshot criteria, repeated runs, failure cases, recovery evidence, acceptance thresholds, and no-cutover failure rules.

## 7. Explicitly out of scope

Production authority, production migration, deleting source evidence, or treating a single happy-path run as acceptance.

## 8. Current repository state

No test harness, rehearsal environment config, migration runner, representative snapshots, backup/recovery record, CI workflow, or deployment configuration is present in the repository.

## 9. Target repository change map

| Path | Action | Purpose | Depends on | Risk | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| supabase/migrations/ | Existing legacy directory — source reference only | Legacy SQL | IR-017 | Critical | Isolated rehearsal plan |
| `Proposed path — verify at packet start: artifacts/rehearsal/` | Proposed path | Retained rehearsal evidence | IR-017 | High | Checksum/recovery review |
| `Proposed path — verify at packet start: scripts/rehearsal/` | Proposed path | Isolated runner only after approval | IR-017 | Critical | Environment approval |

Every proposed path is deliberately labelled **Proposed path — verify at packet start**. No proposed path is an assertion that it already exists.

## 10. Database and data-model work

No schema change. Consume approved transform/migration units only in an isolated representative environment.

## 11. RLS and authorization work

No policy is written by this Draft. The implementation plan must define same-Group success; unrelated-Group, inactive Member, removed Member, archive-state, and direct-object substitution denial; Owner/Member boundaries; service-role confinement; and frontend non-authority. Any cross-Group success or permissive fallback blocks the packet.

## 12. Trusted operations

No browser operation. Any privileged rehearsal runner requires separate environment and secret review.

For every applicable operation, record caller, validated Auth actor, validated current Group relationship and role, transaction boundary, idempotency key, replay/concurrency result, failure response, audit output, service-role use, test evidence, and reconciliation/rollback path.

## 13. Storage work

Rehearse private-object migration/reconciliation and recovery cases without production object mutation.

## 14. Realtime work

Rehearse current authorization/reconnect/removal evidence where environment supports it.

## 15. Frontend implementation

No UI implementation. Use accepted migration/recovery screens as manual communication verification references only.

## 16. Design traceability

Affected Screen IDs: IR-017 recovery/rehearsal MIG states; no additional screen is created.

No annotated export creates behavior beyond its accepted contract. Existing Screen IDs, Component IDs, tokens, navigation, and locked states remain stable unless their separate change-control process approves a change.

## 17. Migration and compatibility

S01–S13/S18 representative evidence, repeated rerun and rollback/recovery outcomes; failures remain retained/quarantined.

## 18. Security acceptance

Required evidence includes same-Group success; unrelated-Group denial; inactive and removed Member denial; Owner/Member boundary; direct object/ID substitution denial; replay and race handling where applicable; service-role confinement; secret handling; and audit-safe output. Failure in a required negative case blocks release consumption.

## 19. Functional acceptance

All required integrated evidence, S01–S13, S18.

## 20. Automated tests

Use current test tooling only where it exists. Repository inspection found no configured test, lint, database-test, browser-test, or CI runner; any new tooling is a proposed dependency for review under IR-001. Planned coverage may include unit, integration, database/RLS, browser, concurrency, idempotency, migration, rollback, visual-regression, and accessibility automation only after the selected tooling and environment capability are approved.

## 21. Manual verification

Inspect affected locked screen states; keyboard/focus behavior; screen-reader announcements; responsive 480px-shell behavior; offline/reconnect/stale behavior; multi-tab behavior; and two-account/two-Group isolation. Where applicable, inspect archive/removal/current-user-change states and browser/device-specific safe-area/native chooser behavior.

## 22. R-02 accessibility obligations

Applicable running-build evidence must cover contrast measurement, touch-target measurement, keyboard order, visible focus, focus trap, focus restoration, connected errors, reduced motion, screen-reader loading/success/error announcements, realtime announcements, and safe-area behavior where relevant.

**R-02 remains open until verified on the running implementation.**

## 23. Observability

Use structured, audit-safe operation results and failure classification; correlation/reference identifiers; security-event evidence; reconciliation status; and release monitoring where applicable. Exclude passwords, tokens, full Invitation secrets, service-role credentials, private document contents, and unnecessary personal data.

## 24. Rollback and recovery

Define packet boundary, reversible and irreversible work, safe stop, data preservation, schema/application rollback, partial failure handling, reconciliation, and release-blocking conditions before implementation. Do not imply all migrations are reversible.

## 25. Implementation sequence

1. Confirm W5 gate ledger. 2. Approve isolated environment/snapshot. 3. Run planned failure/recovery matrix only after future authorization. 4. Retain evidence. 5. Gate IR-018 only after thresholds pass.

Each future step must name its intended outcome, systems/files touched, prerequisite, verification, and rollback point before execution begins.

## 26. Stop conditions

Stop rather than improvise for an architecture or locked-design contradiction, missing fixture, unsafe RLS result, cross-Group access, unreviewed migration ambiguity, unexpected production dependency, impossible rollback, unreviewed design change, or an R-02 defect that blocks the applicable acceptance gate.

## 27. Completion evidence

Before this packet can be Verified, retain reviewed implementation diff/test artifacts, negative security evidence, relevant fixture results, R-02 implementation evidence, rollback/recovery evidence, updated traceability, and an approved packet exit record. Draft status cannot satisfy this gate.

## 28. Open questions

OE-003: rehearsal environment, representative snapshot, backup/recovery capability, and timing baselines are not established.

## 29. Packet exit gate

Dependent work may begin only when this packet has its required evidence, rollback conditions, reviewer decision, and an explicit exit record. This Draft packet neither marks the packet complete nor authorises implementation.

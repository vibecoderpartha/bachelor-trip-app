# W3 — Group lifecycle, storage, and realtime

## Status and authorisation

- Status: Draft
- Implementation authorised: No
- Wave complete: No

## Wave objective

Atomic Group lifecycle, current membership, private document access, subscription cleanup, audit-safe outcomes, and migration identity handling.

## IR packets

- [IR-003 — Atomic Group bootstrap](../packets/IR-003-atomic-group-bootstrap.md)
- [IR-005 — Membership, Invitation and Owner](../packets/IR-005-membership-invitation-and-owner.md)
- [IR-006 — Legacy Participant claiming](../packets/IR-006-legacy-participant-claiming.md)
- [IR-009 — Private Storage](../packets/IR-009-private-storage.md)
- [IR-010 — Authorized realtime](../packets/IR-010-authorized-realtime.md)

## Accepted entry conditions

W2 trusted boundary passes.

## Internal execution order

IR-003 bootstrap precedes IR-005 lifecycle; IR-005 precedes IR-006 claiming. IR-009 and IR-010 may run in parallel only after IR-005, IR-007, and IR-008 are satisfied.

## Parallel work boundaries

Private Storage and authorised Realtime may run in parallel after lifecycle and trusted-boundary gates. Claiming remains serial after membership.

## Shared schema changes

Plan atomic Group bootstrap/configuration, Membership/Invitation/role lifecycle, stable Participant claims, document metadata, private-object model, and authorization inputs for subscriptions.

## Shared frontend changes

Trace ONB, GRP, INV, MBR, CLM, PERM, DOC, and RT states only. Existing App, PersonaPicker, direct hooks, and public scan path remain untouched until their owning packets are authorized.

## Shared security changes

Owner/Member only; opaque single-use invitation secrets; atomic acceptance/claim; no name/emoji/PIN authority; inactive/removed denial; private object substitution denial; current authorized Group subscription; no global notification centre.

## Shared test fixtures

Bootstrap retry/concurrency, invitation expiry/revocation/replay/wrong-account, last-Owner, claim conflict, two-Group object substitution, Group switch clearing/unsubscribe, reconnect, stale-event, archive, and current-user-removal cases.

## Integration checkpoints

Review packet interfaces, shared repository paths, design traceability, R-02 obligations, test fixtures, and rollback assumptions before a dependent packet starts.

## Rollback checkpoint

No partially created Group, Membership, claim, private object, or subscription authority may be exposed; retain safe state and reconcile.

## Required evidence and Wave exit gate

Atomic bootstrap/lifecycle/claim evidence and private/realtime two-Group evidence; no partial authority.

## Downstream consumers

W4 Group-scoped product packets and W5 migration.

## Known risks

Legacy persona state, public tickets bucket, public global channels, and name-based records require controlled replacement.

## Stop conditions

Stop for ownerless/unconfigured Group, invitation replay, claim ambiguity, public object access, or stale realtime delivery.

## Implementation-authorisation status

No

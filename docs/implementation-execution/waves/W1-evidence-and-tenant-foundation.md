# W1 — Evidence and tenant foundation

## Status and authorisation

- Status: Draft
- Implementation authorised: No
- Wave complete: No

## Wave objective

No feature UI, target authority, migration execution, or production data action is permitted.

## IR packets

- [IR-001 — Evidence foundation](../packets/IR-001-evidence-foundation.md)
- [IR-002 — Tenant data foundation](../packets/IR-002-tenant-data-foundation.md)

## Accepted entry conditions

GATE-002 through GATE-005: the package is accepted and locked, IR-001 is
explicitly authorised, and the repository-visible environment-boundary
inventory is complete. A selected test runner, browser harness, RLS harness,
CI platform, test project, deployed-state inventory, or source snapshot is not
required to begin IR-001.

## Internal execution order

IR-001 establishes reproducible evidence capability before IR-002 defines executable Tenant data work. IR-022 governance evidence may be maintained in parallel but does not substitute for either packet.

## Parallel work boundaries

Only static traceability and governance recording may run beside IR-001. IR-002 is serial after IR-001 because schema and parent-path evidence must be testable.

## Shared schema changes

IR-002 may only plan the Group-as-Tenant, Profile, stable Participant/group_members, configuration, audit, archive, foreign-key, index, and generated-type units. No SQL, generated type, or schema change is created in this Wave Draft.

## Shared frontend changes

None. The current fixed five-tab SPA, PersonaPicker, and local persona state are inspection inputs; W1 must not implement or replace them.

## Shared security changes

Define, but do not apply, parent-derived Tenant scope and a deny-by-default transition strategy. Browser-safe and server-only boundaries must be inventoried without recording values.

## Shared test fixtures

Two accounts/two Groups, deterministic clocks, isolated source/fixture data,
failure injection, database/RLS/browser capability, checksum evidence, and
CI-gate selection are IR-001 outputs required at W1 exit (GATE-007–010).

## Integration checkpoints

Review packet interfaces, shared repository paths, design traceability, R-02 obligations, test fixtures, and rollback assumptions before a dependent packet starts.

## Rollback checkpoint

No authoritative change may start; correct the capability or ownership-model gap before W2.

## Required evidence and Wave exit gate

Isolated fixture/schema capability, parent-path and two-Group test design, environment/secret boundary record, and W1 blocker register.

## Downstream consumers

W2 Auth and security packets, plus all later Tenant-scoped work.

## Known risks

Test capability and test-environment boundaries must be established before W1
exit. Deployed topology and source facts first affect W5; they do not block W1
entry.

## Stop conditions

Stop for missing isolated fixture capability, ambiguous parent ownership, or a proposed permissive transition.

## Implementation-authorisation status

No

W1 contains no feature UI implementation.

# Screen contracts

Generated from `manifests/screen-manifest.json`. 462 screens across batches 1–8. This document is derived, not hand-maintained — the manifest is the authority.

IR ownership and wave assignment are derived from the Accepted implementation roadmap. Every screen has one exact IR-001 through IR-022 primary owner, a roadmap-consistent W1 through W7 wave, and related IR items only where a cross-cutting requirement genuinely applies. R-01 is closed; R-02 remains specified for implementation verification.

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-01-sign-in-default-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Email validates on blur, password on submit. Enter submits. Server-confirmed: no navigation until a session exists. Back exits the app.

## AUTH-02 — Sign up

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-02-sign-up-focused-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Three fields only. Name required because it appears next to money. Strength meter advisory, never blocking. Any pending invitation survives into AUTH-03/04.

## AUTH-03 — Email verification required

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Pending, resend disabled |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-03-email-verification-required-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Terminal until the link is opened; the app never guesses. Resend rate-limited with a visible countdown and a disabled button.

## AUTH-04 — Email verified, safe continuation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication -> D Invitation |
| Group | — |
| State | Success |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-04-email-verified-safe-continuation-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Verification carries the invitation forward but never accepts it. Acceptance stays on board 11, server-confirmed. With no pending invitation this becomes ONB-02.

## AUTH-05 — Forgot password

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Sent |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-05-forgot-password-sent-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Identical response whether or not the account exists, and the copy explains why. Back returns to AUTH-01 and focuses the email field.

## AUTH-06 — Reset password

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Validation error + disabled + timed |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Pre-auth shell, password inputs, strength meter, requirement checklist, disabled primary |
| Loading / success / failure | Expired or reused link routes to AUTH-07. Server failure keeps both fields and shows a form-level error. |
| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-06-reset-password-mismatch-disabled-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Confirm field validates on blur then on every keystroke. Saving signs out other sessions and lands on AUTH-01 with a success pill.

## AUTH-07 — Invalid or expired reset link

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Dead end |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Pre-auth shell (no vignette), primary + ghost buttons, quiet info block |

| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-07-invalid-or-expired-reset-link-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

One screen covers invalid, expired and already-used links: the app cannot tell them apart safely and the next step is identical. Deliberately colourless.

## AUTH-08 — Session expiry

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication / G Permissions |
| Group | — |
| State | Blocking dialog over the app |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Modal overlay + 20px sheet, quiet info block, primary button |

| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |
| Architecture reference | Session invalidation |
| IR owner | IR-004 |
| Wave | W2 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-08-session-expiry-over-app-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Only dialog in the package that cannot be dismissed: no backdrop click, no Escape. Focus trapped. Destination and in-progress form preserved and restored after sign-in.

## AUTH-09 — Authentication server error

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Server error |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Pre-auth shell, form-level error block, inputs with values retained, primary button, mono reference |
| Loading / success / failure | Retry re-submits the retained values. Repeated failure surfaces the reference for support. |
| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |
| Architecture reference | Session creation failure |
| IR owner | IR-004 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-09-authentication-server-error-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Typed values kept. Copy separates our fault from wrong credentials without naming which credential failed. Reference is opaque: no status codes, no provider names.

## AUTH-10 — Offline authentication

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication / G Permissions |
| Group | — |
| State | Offline + disabled |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Pre-auth shell, offline pill, dimmed inert inputs, disabled primary |

| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-10-offline-authentication-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Fields stay readable but inert. The primary states what it is waiting for. Reuses the FX offline pill treatment. Re-enables on reconnect; never auto-submits.

## AUTH-11 — Returning user, restoring session

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | A Authentication |
| Group | — |
| State | Loading |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Real header and bottom nav, Trip loading skeleton |

| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/AUTH-11-returning-user-restoring-session-annotated.png` |

Shell renders immediately; only data is skeletal. Replaces the current cold start. Announced once as loading; pulse dropped under reduced motion.

| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

The only moment the product name appears without a trip name. Group concept taught in one sentence, no tour. 72px rows; keyboard order create then join.

## ONB-02 — No Groups yet

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B/C Onboarding |
| Group | — |
| State | Empty + disabled nav |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/ONB-02-no-groups-yet-empty-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Returning account with no Group. The five tabs stay visible at 40% and are not focusable. Same empty-state rhythm as the current Todo empty state.

## ONB-03 — Create Group

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B/C -> J Configuration |
| Group | — |
| State | Default |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/ONB-03-create-group-default-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

A page, not a sheet: browser back must be able to abandon it. Name is set in Fraunces because it becomes the header title. Currency is chosen here so no expense can precede an accounting currency. Leaving with unsaved input asks first.

## ONB-04 — Invalid Group name

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B Onboarding |
| Group | — |
| State | Validation error x2 |

| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Submit-time validation with a form summary plus per-field messages. Focus moves to the name field. Primary stays enabled: a disabled button with no explanation is worse than a readable error.

## ONB-05 — Creating Group

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B Onboarding |
| Group | — |
| State | Action in progress |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Fields dim and become inert, back is disabled, the button states what is happening. Nothing about the destination appears until the Group exists. Double submission impossible. Announced as a polite status.

## ONB-06 — Group creation success

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B -> E Members |
| Group | — |
| State | Success |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Group header, success pill, invite-link block with copy control, primary + ghost + secondary buttons |

Header has already become the Group. Success stated once, then turned into the next action. Copy swaps to a confirmed state for two seconds and is announced. Skipping is always available.

Copy explicitly states nothing was created — a half-made Group is the fear. Retry is client-side idempotent and the form returns editable with values intact and focus on the summary.

## ONB-08 — Join using invitation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | C -> D Invitation |
| Group | — |
| State | Loading, not optimistic |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Back header, mono code input, inline loading block, disabled primary, quiet info block |
| Loading / success / failure | Bad format is owned here. All other outcomes route to the invitation states on board 11. |
| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px with a dark blurred backdrop. No layout changes between viewports. |

| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

Manual path for when a link will not open in-app. A pasted URL is reduced to its code. Validation is a lookup only and never accepts. Copy states that nothing happens until the user confirms.

## ONB-09 — First Group setup, participants

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B -> F Claiming |
| Group | — |
| State | Default + empty + unclaimed rows |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

Where unclaimed participants are created, which is what makes claiming coherent: a participant is a name in the ledger, an account is a login, claiming links the two. The dashed ring is the single grammar for unclaimed across the package.

## ONB-10 — Continue into Trip

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | B -> Trip |
| Group | — |
| State | First run, success |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | Full app shell, Group switcher caret, dashed unclaimed chips, TabHero, timezone toggle, accent prompt, five-tab nav |
| Loading / success / failure | The invite prompt is dismissible and returns via the Group switcher. |
| Validation | See interactionNotes; validation is on blur and on submit, never per keystroke. |
| Permission | Pre-authentication or first-run; no Group permissions apply yet. |

| Status | Accepted — revised against decisions O-01 to O-06 |

The handoff. Everything is the current Trip tab. Three deltas only: a caret on the title, dashed chips for unclaimed participants, one dismissible prompt. Hero copy replaces the persona vibe line, which no longer exists.

Previous Group stays active and intact. Retry is idempotent; a second option offers a different Group.

The explanation is the design: what moves, what does not, and that no amount is recalculated. Real figures so the consequence is checkable.

## CLM-04 — Claim confirmation

| Status | Accepted — revised in batch 3 under O-07 |

O-07 revision: the confirmation now states plainly that the association cannot be swapped afterwards, by anyone. No Owner undo is promised. Last gate before an association a Member cannot reverse; states who can undo it.

One account, one participant per Group — the invariant that keeps the ledger honest.

| Status | Accepted — revised in batch 3 under O-07 |

O-07 revision: no longer routes to an Owner decision. Display-name equality is never sufficient; the claim stops, nothing is linked and nothing is queued. Display-name equality is never sufficient. With no verified relationship, claiming routes to a human decision.

## CLM-10 — Permission denied

| Status | Accepted — revised in batch 3 under O-07 |

O-07 revision: no longer a pending Owner review. Renamed in behaviour to a safe stop that names what did not happen; recovery is an Owner adding a new participant, not a reassignment. Must not look like success — no balance is shown as moved and the user is told they are in as themselves for now.

Both ledgers named as unchanged. Retry idempotent; a claim that actually succeeded resolves to CLM-06.

O-07 revision: removes the promise that an Owner can release and reassign a participant. Owners are named as the people to talk to about adding the right person. Every terminal claim state can reach this. Recovery is a named person, not a support address.

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

Configuration is reached from the Group title in the header, the same control that already switches Groups. Nothing is added to the tab bar, and nothing here is an admin console: five rows, all scoped to this one Group.

## CFG-02 — Owner configuration overview

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

One Group owns all of it: name, destination, dates, canonical IANA timezone, ISO 4217 accounting currency and the approved display context. Six of the seven rows are editable; the accounting currency shows its lock rather than a selector that would fail.

## CFG-03 — Member read-only configuration overview

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

The same permitted values, with every mutation affordance absent rather than dimmed. A Member is not a Viewer — they write Events, expenses and documents all day; they just do not own the Group record.

## CFG-04 — Configuration loading

The accepted skeleton, at the row geometry the settled screen uses. No value is guessed at and no partial configuration is shown, because a half-loaded Group record reads as a changed Group record.

Straight from the permission package, unchanged. One state covers not-a-member, removed, an unknown Group id and a cross-account link, and it never says which.

Archive-aware reads are permitted, so the values stay legible. Every mutation control is absent; the one action an Owner keeps is Restore, because that is what makes the rest of them come back.

Validation fires on submit, not on every keystroke, so a person clearing the field to retype is not scolded mid-thought. Save stays reachable and the error names the field.

A minimum exists only because a one-character trip name is unusable in the switcher and the header. The message says what to do rather than quoting a rule.

No character limit is invented. The rejection is stated without a number, and the counter is drawn here only to show what it looks like once implementation actually owns a configured limit — it is not shipped otherwise.

The field locks, the buttons lock and the header behind still reads the old name. Nothing in the interface commits before the server does.

Confirmation first, then the evidence: the header preview carries the new name because the server confirmed it, not because the field changed. Light personality is allowed here — this is an ordinary, reversible change.

The typed value survives in the field so nobody retypes it, but the effective name is unambiguously the old one. Retry is a plain repeat, not a repair.

Another Owner got there first, so the write is not attempted against a version the server has already replaced. Nothing is auto-merged and nothing is silently overwritten — the person chooses.

Destination is a configured value on the Group, typed by an Owner. It is not derived from Events, not inferred from the timezone, and it does not generate content on its own.

## CFG-16 — Destination required

Independent field validation: an empty destination blocks the destination save and nothing else. A name edit sitting in the same review is unaffected.

A destination change is small and people expect it to be small, so the screen says exactly which four things did not happen. The list exists because “changed the destination” sounds like it should move something.

## CFG-18 — New non-Bali destination

The Bali price guide is approved Bali-only content. A different destination gets its absence stated plainly rather than a generic worldwide guide invented to fill the space.

The mirror of CFG-18. Bali-only content appears because the configured destination is Bali, and the notice names the condition so nobody reads it as a general feature.

Same shape as the name failure, deliberately: previous value effective, typed value retained, retry safe. Configuration failures should be boring and identical.

Two fields, one range, and the night count read back underneath so the range is verified without arithmetic. Dates are interpreted in the Group timezone, which is named on the same line.

The range is validated as a range, so the error sits under the pair rather than blaming one field. Nothing is auto-corrected by swapping the dates — that would guess at intent.

Server-confirmed, then the header line updates. The mono date line is the most-read string in the app, so it is never allowed to run ahead of the record.

A warning, not a repair. The two Events that would fall outside the new range are named, and the screen refuses to offer a tidy-up action — moving or deleting somebody else’s Event is not a side effect of editing dates.

The previous range stays effective and is restated, because a date range that might have half-applied is the kind of thing people re-check three times.

Two Owners, one Group record. The server version wins the comparison and the local edit is never merged into it — a silently blended date range would be nobody’s decision.

A readable place label above the canonical IANA identifier, in that order. The identifier is the stored value; the label is for humans. No fixed UTC offset is presented as the canonical value, because an offset is a consequence, not an identity.

An unrecognised or retired identifier is rejected rather than coerced to something nearby. Silently resolving Asia/Bali to Asia/Makassar would put a value in the record that nobody chose.

The one configuration change people misread as a data migration. Instants are unchanged; their rendering is not. The screen refuses to say Events are shifted, because they are not.

Confirmation restates the identifier rather than the place, because the identifier is what is being written. Calm copy only — there is no joke available about time.

Every time display in the app stays on the old timezone until confirmation. A screen that re-rendered instants mid-save would look like the data moved.

A contract plate, not an executable flow. It exists so the constraint is documented in the product rather than discovered by a person who assumed a dropdown was coming.

A second Group proving the formatting rules are per-Group, not global. Two decimal places, no IDR rounding tolerance anywhere near it, and no Bali converter authority.

IDR carries no minor unit, so none is drawn. Inventing Rp 412.08 would be a formatting bug that reads as a rounding error, and it is exactly the kind of thing a currency-agnostic component gets wrong.

The two things that break money layouts: an eight-figure rupiah total and a currency name longer than the row. The amount never wraps or ellipsises; the name does.

Reference context, kept visibly subordinate to the ledger. The accounting currency appears in the list as required and cannot be removed from accounting presentation.

The same ISO list as the accounting picker, doing a much smaller job. Adding USD here is a display decision and is treated as one throughout.

INR can go; IDR cannot, because it is the accounting currency and removing it from required accounting presentation would leave balances rendered in something that does not own them.

A cheerful confirmation is allowed here, because a display change is genuinely small. The line underneath keeps it honest.

Even a failed display change gets the accounting guarantee restated, because the two are adjacent on screen and a reader should never have to work out which one failed.

The FX tab is the most likely place for someone to believe they have changed the ledger. Three sentences, and a refresh control that visibly recalculates only the reference row.

The general converter travels; the Bali price guide does not. A USD Group gets a working reference converter across its approved display currencies and no Bali content at all.

Each field summarised on its own line, from and to, so the save is read as four separate decisions rather than one blob. The accounting currency is absent because it is not legally editable here — not shown as unchanged, simply not present.

Nothing downstream moves during the save: not the header, not the date line, not an Event time, not a currency label. The whole point of a server-confirmed configuration write is that the app looks unchanged until it is not.

The Group context refreshes once, after confirmation, and everything that depends on it lands in the same frame. No staggered updates, because staggered updates look like a partial save.

Every error is mapped to its own field and the valid rows stay valid. A single summary error at the top would make a person re-check three fields to find one mistake.

The previous effective configuration is intact and is restated field by field, because a multi-field save is exactly where people fear a partial write.

Three explicit choices and no fourth. Auto-merging two Owners’ edits would produce a configuration neither of them approved, so the design refuses it and hands back the text instead.

The write is refused by the server, not hidden by the client. The person lands on the read-only authorised view with the same values they were just looking at, so nothing feels lost.

| Group | H — combined configuration save |
| State | ARCHIVED MID-ACTION |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | CMP-15, PERM-05 |
| Loading / success / failure | Static state. |
| Validation | No form validation on this screen. |
| Permission | Mutation affordances absent rather than disabled. Only an Owner can change configuration; a Member reads the same permitted values. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. Sheets cap at 480px over a dark blurred backdrop. No layout change between viewports and no new breakpoint. |
| Architecture reference | One Group owns name, destination, dates, canonical IANA timezone, ISO 4217 accounting currency and approved display context. Only a current authorised Owner may request a change; every change is server-confirmed and none rewrites identity, membership, recorded instants, Original values, FX evidence or settled history. |

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

Archive won the race, so the save is refused and the route changes to the archive-aware state rather than leaving an editable form floating over a read-only Group.

## CFG-65 — Offline configuration edit

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

Typing is allowed because typing is local. Saving is not, because a server-owned write cannot be queued honestly — a pending settings change that silently loses a race is worse than a disabled button.

## CFG-66 — Reconnecting configuration form

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

The form is not re-enabled on the strength of a network event alone: the current configuration version is fetched first, so a stale save is caught before it is offered.

## CFG-67 — Unsaved changes confirmation

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

The current confirmation-sheet geometry, reused without modification. Discard is the destructive-tinted option because it is the one that loses work; leaving is not destructive and is not treated as such.

## CFG-68 — Header update after confirmed change

| Field | Value |

The effect screen for the two values people actually see all day. Both updated in the same frame, both after confirmation, and the itinerary below is untouched.

## CFG-69 — Timezone presentation after change

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

The same three Events, the same three instants, rendered against a different Group timezone. The abbreviation changes, the moment does not, and the plate says which is which.

## CFG-70 — Finance after display-context change

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow M — Group configuration and accounting currency |
| Group | I — configuration effects |
| State | CONFIRMED EFFECT |

| Status | Accepted — batch 6 |

USD joins the display context and the settlement line still settles in IDR. The reference figure is visually subordinate — smaller, dimmer, prefixed with an approximation sign — so it can never be mistaken for the amount owed.

## CFG-71 — Accounting history remains unchanged

The proof plate. Four values a configuration change could plausibly be accused of touching, shown before and after the whole batch of edits, identical in both columns.

## CFG-72 — Group switch with different configuration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

Three steps in one frame: the old configuration clears, the loading state holds the geometry, and the new name, dates, timezone and accounting currency arrive together. No frame ever shows one Group’s name above another Group’s currency.

## CFG-73 — Group switch failure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

Reuses the Group-switch failure from board 10 rather than inventing a settings-specific one. The previous Group stays selected and internally consistent — name, dates, timezone and currency all still its own.

Restrained: a single line, no reflow, and an explicit refusal to overwrite the form underneath. The banner is an invitation, exactly like the document-list one on board 16.

The seeded trip as one configuration record: approved title, Bali destination, the accepted 22–27 May 2026 range, a validated IANA timezone, IDR accounting authority and the approved INR/IDR display context.

WITA is what people read on the itinerary; Asia/Makassar is what the Group stores. The plate explains the relationship without exposing a single migration table or database field name.

The four facts that keep the migrated ledger auditable: IDR is authority, Original INR and IDR values survive, the legacy 188.68 rate stays a historical fact, and live rates cannot touch any of it.

A quiet persistent banner, not a modal. People are mid-trip; interrupting them with a dialog to announce future maintenance would be worse than the maintenance.

The itinerary, the money, the documents and the todos all stay readable; only the write affordances go. The last line exists because a read-only app is the single most common moment people assume they have been locked out.

Mutation controls are absent, not disabled — the same rule as archived Groups and denied permissions (E-11). The tab bar stays so the app never feels broken.

A cold start during the window lands on the migration state, never a generic server error. “Something went wrong” during planned maintenance is the worst possible first impression.

Three facts in order: it was not saved, the upgrade started, and here is your text. Offering the text back is what turns a lost draft into a two-minute inconvenience.

Normal access returns and, critically, the warning banner is removed. A stale maintenance notice sitting above a fully working app teaches people to ignore every banner after it.

The three finance guarantees, restated during the one operation most likely to be suspected of changing them. Live FX is named explicitly because that is the specific fear.

Historical people stay visible, and no account is inferred for any of them. Claiming is a separate, deliberate act — migration never performs it on someone’s behalf.

A spinner with no words is an app that has hung. Every long-running frame carries the current step and a plain-language status so waiting stays informed rather than anxious.

The two instructions that prevent damage: the Group is protected, and do not retry. A duplicate action started out of impatience is the failure mode this screen exists to prevent.

The first screen after the upgrade shows the active Group, the current membership and, where it applies, a claimable Participant. The persona picker is gone as authority and the copy does not mourn it.

The quiet outcome. When every Participant already maps to an account there is nothing to do, and the screen says so instead of offering an empty claim flow.

Counted, not claimed. Every line is a number the reviewer can check, and the footnote refuses to assert perfection that no evidence supports.

## MIG-22 — Security activation completed

One product sentence for the whole security model. No acronym, no policy name, no mechanism — the promise stated in the terms a person can hold you to.

## MIG-23 — Migration success with non-blocking warnings

| Field | Value |

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

Success and a warning are allowed to coexist. The Group is usable, one document needs attention, and the warning carries a destination rather than a vague caution.

## MIG-24 — Migration stopped before activation

| Field | Value |

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

The upgrade stopped before anything was switched over, so the previous app remains the authority. No half-migrated surface is exposed, and retry is a controlled operation rather than a button.

## MIG-25 — Validation failed safely

The check found something it could not resolve and refused to invent an answer. That refusal is the feature, and the screen says it in the first line.

## MIG-26 — Finance mismatch

Balances are never quietly repaired. The mismatch is named, the originals are untouched, and activation waits for a person — because a silently corrected balance is an argument waiting to happen.

## MIG-27 — Document mismatch

The affected documents are held and the rest of the Group is unaffected. The critical read line is the first: no public fallback was exposed to get around the problem.

## MIG-28 — Participant identity conflict

Two candidates for one Participant, so nothing is linked. The historical Participant survives untouched and recovery is controlled — consistent with O-07, which removed the Owner review queue.

## MIG-29 — Security activation failed

The hardest stop on the board. Partial security is not releasable, so the release is blocked and ordinary users see maintenance rather than an exposed Group.

## MIG-30 — Cross-Group isolation failure

A contract plate, not a screen anyone reaches. If isolation between Groups cannot be proven, release stops — and no ordinary user is ever shown a detail belonging to another Group, including the fact that one exists.

## MIG-31 — Migration failure with rollback available

Failure with a route out. The status is reported honestly as in-progress recovery rather than closed, because a rollback that is running is not a rollback that is done.

## MIG-32 — Migration failure without immediate retry

A Retry button that cannot work is worse than no button. This state offers waiting and controlled support, which are the two things that are actually available.

Not knowing is different from failing, and conflating them causes people to act on a failure that has not happened. This screen says exactly what it does not know.

Access stays restricted while the rollback runs and the operation is explicitly not closed. Declaring success at the start of a recovery is how half-restored states get released.

The required sentence, and only the claim the evidence supports. It says the previous data is in place — not that nothing changed — because a rollback did change things on the way there and back.

The rollback worked and one area still needs a person. Both facts get equal weight, because burying the review under the success is how it stops happening.

Failure with a stated safety envelope and exactly two next actions, matching DOC-69 and CFG-80. “Failed safely” only means something if the screen says what safely means.

A holding state that is honest about being temporary without promising when it ends. Reading works, writing does not, and nobody is locked out of their own history.

Everything returns at once rather than trickling back, and the exact-value guarantee is restated because this is the moment people go and check their balance.

The seeded trip becomes exactly one Group. There is no separate Trip record beside it, because a Group is the Trip workspace and the tenant boundary — a distinction the legacy captures blurred.

Ownership comes from a validated authenticated identity, shown as an email and a role. No internal identifier appears — not shortened, not truncated, not at all.

All five keep their display identity and their emoji; claimed and unclaimed are shown as states, not privileges. The footnote closes the legacy assumption directly.

Explains the change in the language of the product rather than the language of the fix: you sign in as yourself, and picking a face from a list no longer decides who you are.

The E-09 treatment carried into migration: warm neutral, dashed ring, the word UNCLAIMED on the row. Presentation and history, never authority.

## MIG-49 — Claim flow available after migration

Links into the existing claim flow from board 13 rather than duplicating it. Migration creates the opportunity; the claim flow owns the evidence and the outcome.

## MIG-50 — Events and presentation preserved

Events and their presentation relationships survive intact. The footnote is the one that matters: presentation is placement, and it never became document access or a private Event.

## MIG-51 — Finance exact-value evidence

The four finance facts a reviewer will test, on one plate: IDR is authority, Originals survive, the legacy 188.68 rate is historical provenance, and no live rate was substituted anywhere.

The converter survives as reference and nothing more. The boundary is restated at the moment a reader is most likely to assume the migration promoted it.

Your account already maps to a Participant, so there is nothing to claim and the screen says it in one line rather than presenting an empty list.

A second attempt on the same Participant is a no-op with a clear explanation, not an error. Idempotent outcomes should read as calm, not as failure.

Another account already holds it, so the claim stops. Consistent with O-07 there is no Owner review queue and no manual reassignment — the design will not adjudicate identity.

A claim that cannot be evidenced stops safely and states that nothing changed. No review queue exists to escalate into, and inventing one here would contradict a closed decision.

Three concrete routes rather than an apology. Each one is something the person can actually do, and none of them is a queue that does not exist.

The claim belongs to a different account. The screen says so without naming the other account, because confirming which address holds it would be a disclosure.

The one claim failure where retry genuinely can succeed, so it is the only one that offers it. Nothing was linked, so repeating is safe rather than risky.

Claiming requires current membership. Removed from the Group means the claim surface is gone too, and the message never reveals whether the Participant exists.

Explanation only. O-17 resolved this: a reviewed accounting-currency migration is not an ordinary Owner action and there is no executable workflow here — so the screen carries no action that pretends otherwise.

Migration does not grant membership to anyone who did not have it. The generic unavailable treatment is used so the response is identical to every other not-a-member case.

## MIG-82 — Invitation pending after migration

A pending invitation survives the upgrade as a pending invitation. Possession of the link still grants nothing until it is accepted.

## MIG-83 — Invitation expired during maintenance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow P — migration, recovery and implementation-readiness |

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

Expiry is honoured even when maintenance caused the delay, because a link that outlives its window is a link with no window. A new invitation is one tap for an Owner.

## MIG-84 — Session expired during migration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow P — migration, recovery and implementation-readiness |
| Group | J — returning user and session |
| State | SESSION EXPIRED |

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

A session expiry is about the person, not the Group, and the two are never conflated. Signing in again returns to the same place rather than the top of the app.

## MIG-85 — Multiple Groups after migration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow P — migration, recovery and implementation-readiness |
| Group | J — returning user and session |
| State | MULTIPLE GROUPS |

Two Groups, fully isolated. Switching follows the same six-step sequence as RT-10, so no frame ever mixes one Group’s content with another’s configuration.

## MIG-86 — Migrated Group archived

A migrated Group archives exactly like any other. Nothing about having been migrated changes the lifecycle, and the read-only banner is the accepted one.

## MIG-87 — Migrated Group restored

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

Restore returns every action at once and recalculates nothing. The exact-value guarantee matters more here than anywhere, because this Group carries migrated finance.

## MIG-88 — Migration recovery decision matrix

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow P — migration, recovery and implementation-readiness |

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

Every migration state mapped to the one action available from it. The value is in what is missing: several states offer no retry at all, and the matrix says so rather than leaving a hopeful button.

## MIG-89 — Data-change truth table

| Status | Accepted — batch 8 |

Six outcomes that must never be blurred into “done”. Each badge is a distinct claim about what happened to the data, and the design refuses to use a stronger one than the evidence supports.

## MIG-90 — User-facing language versus internal evidence

The board’s closing rule, drawn as two columns. Product copy stays in product language; the identifiers a reviewer needs live in the manifests and the traceability document, never on a screen.

# Board 18

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Health is the absence of chrome. No permanent badge, no green dot, no "live" label — a connected app looks exactly like the accepted app, because a status indicator that is almost always green teaches people to ignore it.

## RT-02 — Connection interrupted

| Field | Value |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

One quiet pill under the sticky header, at the point where a person would otherwise wonder whether the list is current. It states the condition and what is on screen, and it does not block anything readable.

## RT-03 — Reconnecting

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

The only motion is a slow pulse on a 6px dot. The reduced-motion branch is drawn beside it, because "reconnecting" is exactly the state a vestibular-sensitive person will be staring at.

## RT-04 — Reconnected

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Level 2. The toast says the two things that matter — the connection is back and the data was refreshed — then it leaves. Nothing persistent is added, because a permanent "you are online" badge is noise.

## RT-05 — Offline with cached content

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/RT-05-offline-with-cached-content-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Everything already loaded stays readable and every mutation affordance goes. There is no offline queue in the current accepted scope, so the design refuses to promise that anything typed now will be sent later.

## RT-06 — Offline with no cached content

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

The critical distinction on this board: an empty screen because there is no connection is not an empty Group. The copy never says "no events yet", because that sentence would be false and alarming.

## RT-07 — Reconnect failed

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | A — connection lifecycle |
| State | RECONNECT FAILED |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

| Annotated export | `screens/mobile/annotated/RT-07-reconnect-failed-annotated.png` |
| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

A failed reconnect is a network fact, not an access decision. Nobody is signed out and nothing suggests permission was withdrawn — the content that was already safe to read stays on screen behind the notice.

## RT-08 — Session valid, realtime unavailable

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | A — connection lifecycle |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Live updates are a convenience layer; reads and server-confirmed writes are the product. This state separates the two so a person keeps working instead of assuming the app is broken.

## RT-09 — Realtime restored after prolonged interruption

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

After a long gap the stream cannot be trusted to have carried everything, so the design re-fetches authorised data first and only then says the screen is current. Order matters more than speed here.

## RT-10 — Group switch during reconnect

Six ordered steps, drawn as a contract. The unsubscribe and the clear both happen before anything from the new Group is requested, which is what makes a mixed-Group frame impossible rather than unlikely.

## RT-11 — New Event received

Level 3: the itinerary materially changed, so the notice persists until it is looked at. Presentation filtering is applied before the row and before the count, so an Event not presented to this Participant leaves no trace at all.

Level 1 plus a whisper. The card updates in place at the same scroll offset, and the only addition is one attribution line that explains why the time on screen just changed.

Level 4. The local edits stay exactly where they are, the remote version is offered rather than applied, and there is no merge. Saving still goes through the server-confirmed stale-version check even if the person chooses to keep editing.

## RT-14 — Event removed while visible

The card goes only after the removal is confirmed by an authorised read, not on the strength of the message alone. A row that vanishes and comes back is worse than a row that leaves half a second late.

The save is stopped before it is attempted, because writing to a record that no longer exists produces the worst error message in the product. Typed notes are offered back so the work is not lost with the record.

An Event can enter or leave this Participant’s itinerary presentation. The copy describes the effect on this person only and never enumerates who else the Event is presented to.

The new row appears at the end of the pending list and the caret stays exactly where it was. Focus theft in a shared todo list is the fastest way to make two people type over each other.

The row moves to completed in place with a brief attribution, because "who ticked this" is genuinely useful in a group list and costs one line.

## RT-19 — Todo removed while visible

The row leaves cleanly and the list closes the gap. No empty shell, no strikethrough ghost, no "this item was deleted" placeholder sitting in a list people scan quickly.

Even for a todo, an overwrite is an overwrite. The same conflict treatment as an Event or a settings form, at a smaller scale, so the pattern is learned once.

A bulk change to the completed section must not shift the pending list under a reading finger, so the completed block collapses in place and the pending block keeps its offset.

The ledger row, the Group total and every balance move in the same frame, and only once the accepted server record exists. A total that updates a beat after its expense reads as an arithmetic bug.

Every dependent value is recomputed and painted together. Partially updated finance is the one class of realtime bug people notice instantly and never trust again.

Reuses the finance stale-data treatment from board 15 rather than inventing a realtime-specific one. Money forms never auto-merge, at any scale.

The person who recorded the settlement also receives the realtime event describing it. Both refer to one accepted record, so the design shows one success and one history row — the echo is absorbed, not rendered.

While recovering, the whole finance context is re-read and swapped in one step. Cached balances beside fresh expense rows would produce a total nobody can reconcile.

A realtime change touching a record attributed to someone who has left keeps that attribution intact. Presence in history is not presence in the Group, and the update does not quietly restore authority.

The row appears only after current same-Group authorisation is confirmed for this reader. There is no per-document audience to describe, so the notice describes the document and its uploader and stops there.

Five states kept distinct in the live update exactly as they are in the document flow, because "processing" collapsing into one spinner is what made the single-user build unexplainable.

The Event enters this person’s itinerary only if the accepted presentation rules put it there. The notice names the Event and the person, never the presentation list.

## RT-32 — Document removed while list is open

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

The row goes after confirmation and the Event it produced stays, which is the separation E-15 approved. A person watching the list sees exactly the outcome the removal confirmation promised.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Content is torn down before the message is drawn. An unavailable-document notice floating over a still-rendered page would be a leak with a lock icon on it.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

The held badge clears on the authorised row and nothing internal surfaces — no path, no bucket, no object identifier, no job name.

## RT-35 — Member joined

Four surfaces update from one event: the member list, the participant rail, the pending invitation row and the Group count. One message covers all four.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Two very different outcomes on one plate. Someone else leaving is a list update with history preserved; the current user being removed is a teardown — clear, unsubscribe, route — in that order.

## RT-37 — Role changed from Member to Owner

|---|---|

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

New controls appear only after the membership refresh confirms the new role. Rendering Owner actions from a realtime message alone would put buttons on screen that the server will refuse.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Owner-only controls are removed rather than disabled, matching E-11. A dead privileged button is both a usability failure and a hint about what exists.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Promotions and demotions change who is allowed to leave. The protections refresh from confirmed membership so a person is never blocked by a rule that no longer applies, or allowed past one that now does.

The row updates and the token never returns to the screen. A revoked or accepted invitation is a status change, not an occasion to re-display a secret.

The header changes after the Group record is re-read, not when the message arrives. The header is the most-trusted string in the app and it never runs ahead of a confirmed read.

The mono date line updates and nothing else does. Events outside the new range stay exactly where they were recorded, as CFG-24 promised.

Every displayed local time re-renders in one pass so the itinerary is never half in one zone and half in another. The instants themselves are untouched, and the copy says so.

A reference row appears or disappears and no ledger figure moves. The plate restates the boundary because this is the update most likely to be misread as a money change.

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

Archive takes effect immediately in presentation: mutation affordances are removed the moment the change is confirmed, so nobody starts an action the server is already refusing.

## RT-46 — Group restored

Controls come back only after the authorised Group state is re-read. Restoring from a message alone would show write buttons against a Group that has not finished coming back.

The same stale-configuration notice as board 17, delivered by the realtime channel instead of a failed save. Local text is never silently replaced.

The one conflict surface every form reuses — Event, todo, expense, settings. Same words, same three actions, same refusal to merge, so the pattern costs a person one lesson.

One generic treatment for removed, reconciled away, or never-authorised. Not-found and not-allowed stay indistinguishable, exactly as they are everywhere else in the package.

Four causes that feel identical to a user and must not be: a role change keeps you in the Group, a removal does not, an archive is temporary, and an expired session is about you rather than the Group.

One expense mutation fans out into a ledger row, a total, three balances and a suggested transfer. That is one change to a person, so it gets one message and one summary line.

## RT-52 — Duplicate realtime event

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | H — global conflict and update states |
| State | DEDUPLICATED |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | — |
| Loading / success / failure | Static state. |
| Validation | No form validation on this screen. |
| Permission | Group-scoped and authorised; nothing renders before the current reader is authorised. |
| Responsive | 480px capped column; centred on tablet 768 and desktop 1440 with the base background around it. No layout change between viewports and no new breakpoint. |
| Architecture reference | Realtime is presentation only. Updates are Group-scoped and authorised; nothing renders from a payload alone, and no control, row, count or value is granted by a realtime message. Backend authorization remains authoritative. |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

The same accepted record can arrive twice through retry or reconnection. Presentation is idempotent by record identity, so the second delivery changes nothing on screen at all.

## RT-53 — Out-of-order realtime events

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | H — global conflict and update states |
| State | ORDERING |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | CMP-70 |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

A late-arriving older revision is never painted over a newer accepted state. Where ordering cannot be established, the design stops guessing and re-reads authorised data.

## RT-54 — Realtime payload cannot be reconciled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | H — global conflict and update states |
| State | OUT OF SYNC |
| Viewport | 393x852 |
| Components | CMP-70 |

| Status | Accepted — batch 7 |

When an update cannot be matched to anything on screen, the honest answer is that the screen may be stale — followed by a real refresh. No codes, no payloads, no channel names.

## RT-55 — Current screen is no longer authorised

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Flow | Flow N — realtime, notifications and connection states |
| Group | H — global conflict and update states |
| State | CLEARED THEN ROUTED |
| Viewport | 393x852 |

Clear first, route second, message third. The sequence is the contract: no inaccessible content ever sits behind a dialog waiting to be screenshotted.

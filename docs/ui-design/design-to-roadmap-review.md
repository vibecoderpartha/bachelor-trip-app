# Design-to-Roadmap Review

## Status

- Import status: Complete
- Design-to-roadmap traceability: Complete
- UI/UX Design Package: Accepted
- UI/UX Design Lock: Complete
- Full UI/UX Design Freeze: Complete
- Application implementation: Not started
- Implementation authorised: No
- Execution packets: Not yet created or accepted
- Deployment authorised: No

## Summary

- 462 screens
- 86 components
- 13 screen families
- 22 IR items
- 7 Waves
- 462 mapped screens; 0 unmapped screens
- UI-01 through UI-14: 14 of 14 mapped to their accepted-roadmap owners
- Open accessibility verification: R-02 — Specified; implementation verification required

R-01 is closed: validation confirms every Screen ID has one valid primary `irOwner`, a roadmap-consistent `wave`, and no invented active IR/Wave identifier. Static design acceptance and lock do not authorise application implementation.

## Architecture review

- **Group-is-Trip:** Group-switch and lifecycle screens preserve one Group as one Trip tenant; no permanent Group deletion is designed.
- **Auth authority:** Auth screens use session authority and do not retain persona, PIN, Profile, or invitation possession as authority.
- **Invitations and Owner/Member model:** invitation, membership, and last-Owner screens map to IR-005 and retain only Owner and Member roles.
- **Participant claiming:** claiming screens map to IR-006, preserve stable identity, and stop safely rather than infer authority from a name or emoji.
- **Deny-by-default access:** permission screens retain server-confirmed denial and feature-specific primary owners with IR-007 references.
- **Finance exactness:** finance screens map to IR-014; live FX does not rewrite historical accounting values and custom unequal-split authoring is absent.
- **Private documents:** direct private-viewer/access states map to IR-009; scan/reconciliation states map to IR-013; no public URL or separate document audience is claimed.
- **Group configuration:** configuration screens use IR-015 or IR-014 for accounting currency and retain Owner-only server confirmation.
- **Realtime isolation:** the realtime family maps to IR-010; payloads are presentation only and current authorisation remains authoritative.
- **Migration and rollback:** migration communication, transforms, recovery, readiness, and governance map to IR-016–IR-018, IR-021, or IR-022 without claiming cutover authority.

## Remaining review items

- R-02 — **Specified; implementation verification required.** Measure contrast, keyboard traversal/focus restoration, reduced motion, and screen-reader announcement behaviour on a running build. This is not a static-design failure.

## Recommendation

Traceability is complete and accepted. The next authorised activity is creation, review, and lock of the W1–W7 implementation execution packets; application implementation remains blocked pending the final implementation-readiness gate.
